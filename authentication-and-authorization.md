Here are some best practices for using JWT for authentication and authorization:

### 1. Secure Token Generation: 
When generating JWTs, use strong cryptographic algorithms and keys to sign the tokens. Avoid using weak algorithms or short key lengths, as they can compromise the security of the tokens.

### 2. Token Expiration: 
Set an appropriate expiration time for the tokens. Short-lived tokens reduce the risk of unauthorized access if a token is stolen. Typically, JWTs have an expiration timestamp in the payload, which should be validated on the server-side.

### 3. Secure Token Storage: 
Store JWTs securely on the client-side. Avoid storing sensitive information in the token's payload, as it can be decoded by anyone. If needed, include only non-sensitive information or a token identifier, and store sensitive data on the server-side.

### 4. Token Revocation: 
Implement a mechanism to revoke or invalidate tokens if necessary. This can be achieved by maintaining a blacklist of revoked tokens on the server-side or using token revocation techniques like token blacklisting or token rotation.

### 5. HTTPS Usage: 
Always transmit JWTs over a secure HTTPS connection to prevent interception or tampering. Using HTTPS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the tokens during transmission.

### 6. Token Validation: 
Before granting access to protected routes, validate the authenticity and integrity of the JWTs on the server-side. Verify the token's signature using the secret key or a public key if you're using asymmetric cryptography.

Here's an example of using JWT for authentication and authorization in a Node.js middleware function:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function authenticate(req, res, next) {
    // Get the token from the request header or query string
    const token = req.headers.authorization || req.query.token;

    if (!token) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
    }

    try {
        // Verify and decode the token
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret-key');
    
        // Attach the decoded payload to the request object for further use
        req.user = decoded;
    
        // Continue to the next middleware or route handler
        next();
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
    }
}

// Usage example in a protected route
app.get('/protected', authenticate, (req, res) => {
    // Access the authenticated user's information from req.user
    const userId = req.user.id;
    // Perform actions for authorized users
});
```
In the above example, the authenticate middleware function checks for the presence of a JWT in the request header or query string. It then verifies the token using the specified secret key and attaches the decoded payload to the req.user object. If the token is valid, the request is allowed to proceed to the protected route handler.

These best practices help ensure the security and reliability of your authentication and authorization mechanism when using JWTs. However, it's important to stay updated with the latest security practices and vulnerabilities to adapt your implementation accordingly.
