## üìÅ MVC Pattern:
The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a software architectural design pattern commonly used in web development to separate concerns and organize code in a structured and maintainable manner. It divides an application into three major components: Models, Views, and Controllers.

## ‚ú® Consistent Code Style:
Consistent Code Style refers to the practice of maintaining a uniform and standardized format for writing code across a project or a development team. It helps improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration. ESLint, a popular JavaScript linter, can be used in combination with a widely adopted style guide like Airbnb or Standard.js to enforce consistent code style.

## üöÄ Use Latest Versions:
Keep your Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB versions up to date to benefit from bug fixes and new features.

## ‚úÖ Input Validation and Sanitization:
Input Validation and Sanitization are crucial steps in ensuring the security and integrity of user inputs in a software application. By using a validation library such as Joi or express-validator, developers can verify that the input data meets the required criteria and sanitize it to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

[Read More](input-validation-and-sanitization.md)

## üõ† Proper Error Handling:
Proper error handling is a critical aspect of software development that ensures robustness, reliability, and a positive user experience. By implementing error handling middleware, developers can catch and manage errors effectively, providing appropriate feedback to users and maintaining the stability of the application.

[Read More](error-handling.md)

## üîê Authentication and Authorization:
Authentication and authorization are critical aspects of building secure and reliable web applications. One popular approach to implement authentication and authorization is by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.

[Read More](authentication-and-authorization.md)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Use Environment Variables:
Store sensitive information like database credentials or API keys in environment variables. For example, use process.env.MONGODB_URI to store the MongoDB connection string.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Rate Limiting:
Rate limiting is a technique used to control and restrict the number of requests made by a client or IP address within a given timeframe. It helps protect web applications from abuse, DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, and ensures fair usage of resources. Implementing rate limiting middleware can be an effective way to enforce these restrictions.

[Read More](ratelimiting.md)

## üìÑ Pagination and Filtering:
Pagination and filtering are important features to consider when designing API endpoints that retrieve and display large sets of data. Pagination allows the retrieval of data in smaller, manageable chunks, while filtering enables clients to specify criteria for retrieving specific subsets of data.

[Read More](pagination-and-filtering.md)

## üì¶ Caching:
Caching is a technique used to store and serve frequently accessed data in order to improve performance and reduce the load on backend systems. By caching data, subsequent requests for the same data can be served from the cache instead of making expensive operations, such as querying a database or performing complex calculations.

[Read More](caching.md)

## üìù Logging:
Logging is an essential practice in software development that involves recording events and errors that occur within an application. It provides valuable insights into the runtime behavior of an application, aids in debugging, and facilitates monitoring and troubleshooting.

[Read More](logging.md)

## üö¶ Middleware:
Use middleware functions to handle common tasks. For example, create a middleware function that parses request bodies and attaches them to the request object.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üóúÔ∏è Compression:
Compression is a technique used to reduce the size of data being transmitted or stored, resulting in improved network efficiency and reduced bandwidth consumption. In the context of web applications and APIs, compression can significantly enhance performance by reducing the amount of data sent over the network.

[Read More](compression.md)

## ‚úîÔ∏è Unit Tests and Integration Tests:
Unit tests and integration tests are essential components of a robust testing strategy for Node.js applications. They help ensure the correctness and reliability of your API endpoints.

[Read More](unit-tests-and-integration-tests.md)

## ‚ö° Asynchronous Operations:
Use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking code and ensure responsiveness. For example, use async/await or Promises instead of synchronous functions.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üìä Database Indexing:
Create indexes on frequently accessed fields in your MongoDB collections to improve query performance. For example, create an index on the email field of a User collection.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üé£ Mongoose Middleware Hooks:
Use Mongoose middleware hooks to perform actions before or after certain operations. For example, use a pre-hook to hash a user's password before saving it to the database.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üìÆ Request/Response Logging:
Log incoming requests and outgoing responses to track API usage and monitor performance. For example, log the request method, URL, and response status code for every API request.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üì¢ API Versioning:
Implement API versioning to allow for backward compatibility. For example, prefix your routes with a version number like /v1/users to indicate the API version.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üåê CORS:
Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to control access to your API from different domains. For example, set appropriate CORS headers to allow requests from specific origins.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üîí SSL/TLS (HTTPS):
Enable SSL/TLS (HTTPS) to secure data transmission between clients and your API. For example, use a tool like Let's Encrypt to obtain and install an SSL certificate.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üîç Request Validation at Gateway/Proxy Level:
Use an API gateway or reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) to perform request validation before it reaches your API server. For example, configure the gateway to reject requests with invalid headers or payloads.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üéØ Database Connection Pooling:
Use connection pooling to optimize resource usage and improve performance. For example, use a library like generic-pool to manage a pool of MongoDB connections.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## ‚ö° Query Optimization in MongoDB:
Optimize query performance by using projection, indexing, and aggregations in MongoDB. For example, only retrieve the necessary fields in a query and ensure relevant fields are properly indexed.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## ‚úÖ Data Validation and Constraints:
Implement data validation and constraints at the database level using Mongoose schemas. For example, define a maximum length constraint on a string field using the maxlength option.

Read More (Coming soon!)

## üìà Performance Monitoring:
Regularly monitor and optimize your API's performance using tools like New Relic, Datadog, or custom logging and monitoring solutions. For example, use New Relic to monitor response times and identify performance bottlenecks.
